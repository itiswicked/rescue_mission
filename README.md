== README

This an application that helped me solidify some core rails ideas:
- Forms can be associated with model objects.
- Resources can be nested in other resources to create new, meaningful routes.

to run the app, use the standard procedure:

```
git clone <url>
cd rescue_mission
bundle
rails s
```
